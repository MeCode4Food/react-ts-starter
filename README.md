# A React Webapp written in TypeScript

## Why TypeScript
Because I prefer compile-time errors. 

## Why Torture Yourself
Because I prefer Fried Chicken over runtime errors

## Why is ./build in your commit
Because my VM instance doesn't have the memory to do the compilation ☹️
Bear with me while I compile locally and commit the build. You can compile it yourself if you'd like
